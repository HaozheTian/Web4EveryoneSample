                <h3>Undergraduate Researcher, Beihang University</h3>
                <p>
                    Joined a team of four to develop an automated optical measurement method based on deep learning and self-correlation. 
                    The method is utilized to characterize Back Focal Plane-typed Surface Plasmon Microscopy (BFP-typed SPM), which has 
                    great potential in optical measurement and biosensing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system is capable of 1) automatically determine polarization 
                    modes of surface plasmon (SP) profiles on BFP, and 2) conduct center determination on SP profiles that 
                    previous algorisms are inapplicable to, and 3) conduct fast and accurate measurement of BFP-typed SPM.
